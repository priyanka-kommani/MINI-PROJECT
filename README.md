# IMAGE COMPRESSION
An autoencoder CNN is a type of Deep neural network that works by learning a
compressed representation of an image and then using that representation to reconstruct
the image. The process involves two main parts: the encoder and the decoder. The
encoder takes an input image and applies a series of convolutional and pooling layers to
it. These layers reduce the dimensions of the image while extracting important features
from it. The output of the encoder is a compressed representation of the image in a
lower-dimensional space.
The compressed representation is then passed to the decoder, which applies a series of
deconvolutional and upsampling layers to it. These layers gradually increase the
dimensions of the representation until it is the same size as the original image. The output
of the decoder is the reconstructed image. During training, the autoencoder CNN is
trained to minimize the difference between the original image and the reconstructed
image using a loss function. By doing this, the network learns to represent the image in a
lower-dimensional space while still preserving the important features of the image.
The compressed representation can be stored in a smaller memory space compared to the
original image, which makes it easier to transmit and store the image. When the
compressed image needs to be reconstructed, the decoder of the autoencoder CNN is used
to generate the reconstructed image from the compressed representation
