# IMAGE COMPRESSION
An autoencoder CNN is a type of Deep neural network that works by learning a
compressed representation of an image and then using that representation to reconstruct
the image. The process involves two main parts: the encoder and the decoder. The
encoder takes an input image and applies a series of convolutional and pooling layers to
it. These layers reduce the dimensions of the image while extracting important features
from it. The output of the encoder is a compressed representation of the image in a
lower-dimensional space.
The compressed representation is then passed to the decoder, which applies a series of
deconvolutional and upsampling layers to it. These layers gradually increase the
dimensions of the representation until it is the same size as the original image. The output
of the decoder is the reconstructed image. During training, the autoencoder CNN is
trained to minimize the difference between the original image and the reconstructed
image using a loss function. By doing this, the network learns to represent the image in a
lower-dimensional space while still preserving the important features of the image.
The compressed representation can be stored in a smaller memory space compared to the
original image, which makes it easier to transmit and store the image. When the
compressed image needs to be reconstructed, the decoder of the autoencoder CNN is used
to generate the reconstructed image from the compressed representation

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model that is particularly effective for analyzing visual data, such as images and videos. CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

The architecture of a CNN is inspired by the visual cortex of the human brain, which processes visual stimuli in a hierarchical manner. The main building blocks of a CNN are convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Convolutional layers are responsible for learning local patterns and features from the input data. They consist of a set of learnable filters or kernels that convolve over the input image, performing element-wise multiplications and summations. This process helps capture spatial relationships and detect local features, such as edges, corners, and textures.

Pooling layers, typically implemented as max pooling or average pooling, downsample the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers. They reduce the spatial dimensions of the features while retaining the most important information. Pooling helps make the CNN more robust to variations in the position or size of the detected features.

Fully connected layers are traditionally used at the end of a CNN to make predictions based on the learned features. These layers take the flattened and pooled feature maps and pass them through one or more fully connected (dense) layers, which perform non-linear transformations and output the final predictions.

The training of a CNN involves feeding it with labeled training examples and optimizing its parameters (weights and biases) using techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent. CNNs learn to automatically extract hierarchical representations of the input data, gradually learning more abstract and complex features as they progress through the layers.

The success of CNNs in various computer vision tasks can be attributed to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from raw pixel data, enabling them to capture intricate patterns and structures in images. CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks like image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and even more advanced tasks like image generation and style transfer.
